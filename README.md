<br/>
Hovering over or moving the cursor over the icon will show various options.

A blue checkmark in the options means that the user can see that option on the map.
An empty box means the user can not see the option on the map.
The first option is to toggle the points on or off. The rest of the options are politcal boundaries:
<ul>
<li>Assembly District </li> 
<li>Borough</li> 
<li>Congressional District</li>
<li>City Council District</li> 
<li>Community District</li> 
<li>Senate District</li>
</ul>
The user can view politcal boundaries on the map by clicking on the empty box in the options. 
If the user wants to try other boundarues, it is advised to turn off the previous political boundary.

## Asset information and zooming
User can zoom by scrolling with the mouse or clicking on the + in the top left corner.
Users can navigate around the map by dragging the cursor (left click and move the cursor simultaneously)

## Politcal Boundaries and dynamic charts 
The chart at the bottom illustrates the assets installed over time and will dynamically update 
when the user selects a politcal boundary and district. Dynamically means when the user selects another 
district or district from another poltical boundary.

the Toggle Points from the control twice (off then on).

selected.
