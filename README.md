Hovering over or moving the cursor over the icon will show various options.
The first option is to toggle the points on or off
The rest of the options are politcal boundaries:
<ul>
<li>Assembly District </li> 
<li>Borough</li> 
<li>Congressional District</li>
<li>City Council District</li> 
<li>Community District</li> 
<li>Senate District</li>
</ul>
The user can view politcal boundaries on the map by clicking on the empty box in the options. 
If the user wants to try other boundarues, it is advised to turn off the previous political boundary.

## Politcal Boundaries and dynamic charts 
The chart at the bottom illustrates the assets installed over time and will update 
only when the user selects a politcal boundary. In addition, the chart will update
dynamically when clicking on another district for a politcal boundary district.
